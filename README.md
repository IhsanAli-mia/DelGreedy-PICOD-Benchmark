# DelGreedy vs. SOTA PICOD Algorithms Benchmark

A comparative evaluation of DelGreedy against state-of-the-art algorithms for PICOD-1 (t=1) and PICOD-t (t>1) problems.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and benchmarking code for multiple algorithms solving the PICOD (Pliable Index Coding) problem:


<ul>
  <li>**DelGreedy** (Our proposed algorithm)</li>
  <li>**Algorithm 1** From paper <a>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10389</a></li>
</ul>
